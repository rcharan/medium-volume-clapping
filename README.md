The issues section follows the [Rumsfeld Classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns)
## Known knowns
- If you attempt to terminate the program while the browser is starting up, it will crash and reach an undesirable state. To recover, you should quit (not close) chromedriver (the browser)
- Loading links to be scraped from a file is not currently implemented
- Clicking without making a user profile is not currently implemented
## Known unknowns
- Medium pages under other branding may have extra popups or content that interfere
with clicking or finding the clapping button. Some reasonable attempts are made to
handle this. In some cases, you may find that just trying again fixes the issue (really). Otherwise, you will have to click manually
## Unknown unknowns
- ...did you expect to find anything here?
